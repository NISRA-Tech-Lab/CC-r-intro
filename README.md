# R: Not just for technical wizards
## NISRA Coffee and Coding - R and RStudio Introduction

### Setup 
Download the .zip folder of this repo (green code button dropdown to top right, then select "Download ZIP").

Unzip this folder to a location on your machine e.g. Desktop

Open the folder and open the _"r-intro-coffee-coding.Rproj"_ file. This should open an instance of RStudio

In your console (usually the left hand portion of the screen in RStudio), type and return `renv::restore()`, entering `Y` when prompted
  - If the install flags up errors and stops, you may not have access to the package repository needed to install packages within this project. Contact techlab@nisra.gov.uk for more info on this
  - You should still be able to run the script below up to the packages setion, even without completed installs, as the earlier parts use BASE R code only

Open _"r-intro-coffee-coding.R"_ and run through code
